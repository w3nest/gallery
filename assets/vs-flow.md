# üß© **Visual Studio Flow**

This chapter showcases applications created using **Visual Studio Flow** (VS-Flow), a low-code engine for building
high-performance and flexible applications.

## üí° **What is Visual Studio Flow?**

Visual Studio Flow is a **low-code ecosystem** designed to streamline application creation while maintaining 
flexibility and performance. It allows users to build applications by piecing together pre-designed modules 
in a **step-by-step** manner, where each module encapsulates a specific function or feature. 
These modules are connected to form an efficient **workflow**.

<note level="warning">
The term 'low-code' doesn't mean 'easy' for complex applications. While Visual Studio Flow simplifies many aspects, 
building sophisticated applications still requires expertise in software design.

## ‚ú® **Key Features**

Visual Studio Flow offers a variety of features that empower developers to create powerful applications:

* **üåê Browser-Based Application**: Operates directly in the web browser, eliminating the need for installation and
  simplifying environment sharing across teams.

* **‚ö° On-the-Fly Dependency Installation**: Developers can easily install dependencies from 
  <ext-link target="webpm">WebPM</ext-lik> directly within the workflow. This feature allows modules to autonomously 
  integrate and utilize external dependencies, such as ESM, backends or Pyodide packages.

* **üîÑ Robust Data Flow Management**: The heart of Visual Studio Flow is its **reactive data flow engine**,
  based on **<ext-link target="reactivex">ReactiveX API</ext-link>**. This ensures a safe, performant, and composable 
  framework for managing dataflows across various modules in your application.
