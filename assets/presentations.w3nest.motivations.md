<note level='hint' title="Untapped Potential">
Countless web-based components (backends, ESM modules, and other) are already available on platforms like GitHub.
Yet, most remain **out of reach** in action because deploying them is **complex**, **time-consuming**, and **costly**—
trapped behind the barriers of cloud infrastructure.

The result? **A vast ecosystem of solutions, largely unused**. 
This isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a **systemic failure** in accessibility and adoption.

## Modular Ecosystem for Web-Based Applications

* Designed to support applications built around **web components**, including:

  * **Web Apps & ESM Modules**: Unified compilation target leveraging standard browser views.

  * **Containerized Backends**: Cross-platform, multi-language support.

  * **Interoperable Components**: UI components seamlessly integrate; backends communicate via HTTP requests.

---

## A Collaborative and Scalable System

* **Open Ecosystem**: Anyone can publish components, making them instantly available to others.

* **Scalability Without Complexity**: Components designed the 'old-way' : without the overhead of traditional 
  cloud-based deployment regarding scalability.

---

## A Dynamic & Extensible Environment

* **R&D-Friendly**: Supports runtime plug-and-play functionality via ESM and backend modules.

* **On-the-Fly Installation**: Dynamically install new components from the ecosystem.

* **Use Cases**: Ideal for notebooks, low-code applications, and plugin-based architectures.
