# ⚠️ **Challenges with Cloud-Based Platforms**

---

<note level="hint" title="The Hidden Complexity of Cloud Platforms">  

Cloud platforms offer **scalability** and **convenience**, but they also come with **significant overhead**
—from infrastructure management to access control and pricing models.  
What should be a straightforward deployment often becomes a **complex and costly process**, limiting **flexibility** 
and **accessibility**.  

**Accidental or incidental complexity?**
</note>

## 🚫 **Restricted Backend Deployment**
  
* Most cloud providers don’t offer an easy way for **individual users** to deploy their own backends:
  
  * **Orchestrating multiple layers of infrastructure** (containers, databases, networking, security).
  
  * **No default mechanism** to automatically assign personal backend instances to users.
  
  * Ensuring **scalability**, **security**, and **cost-efficiency** is a non-trivial challenge.

---

## 📈 **Scalability Challenges**

* Even though backends may serve a **single user**, they often require **concurrent instances** to handle scaling, complicating the infrastructure.

---

## 💸 **Cost & Resource Management**

* **Who pays** for scaling thousands of services?

* How to balance **availability** and **affordability**?

---

## 🔒 **Data Privacy Concerns**

* Deployed backends often require published data, but **security concerns** can prevent this.

* **Scientific data** is frequently produced locally, and **sharing** it with backends is the primary goal, not publishing it.

---

## 🛠️ **Developer Workflow Issues**

* Scientists and engineers typically work on **local machines**.
  
* Proper testing demands **cloud deployment** and **remote debugging**, introducing unnecessary friction into the workflow.
