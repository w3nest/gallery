# **W3Nest Gallery**

Welcome to the **W3Nest Gallery** — a curated collection of interactive **showcases** that demonstrate how 
<ext-link target="w3nest">W3Nest</ext-link> can be used to design, explore, and share scientific applications.
Most examples are presented as **notebooks**, but the same features can serve as building blocks for full-fledged
**applications**, illustrating the flexibility of the framework.

<note level="warning" title="Backend Installation Required">  
Some showcases require additional **backend services** injected into the W3Nest environment. 
These examples cannot run directly online, they will only work when served from 
the **local W3Nest server**. A clear warning is displayed at the beginning of such pages.
