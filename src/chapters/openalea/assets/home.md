<ext-link target="openalea.openalea">Openalea</ext-link> is an open-source framework for **plant modeling and 
simulation**. It provides tools to represent plants as **multiscale tree graphs (MTGs)**, which capture both geometry 
(branching structures, leaves, roots) and functional processes (growth, physiology). 
With OpenAlea, researchers can combine mathematical models, biophysical rules, and empirical data to study plant 
architecture, morphogenesis, and interaction with the environment. It has been widely used in **computational botany**, 
for instance to simulate light interception, carbon allocation, and 3D plant development using models like the 
**Weberâ€“Penn tree generator**.

This chapter provides interactive example of Openalea usage, both in term of notebook-like page and using
the vs-flow low code engine.

You'll find:

-  <cross-link target="openalea.vs-flow">VS-Flow</cross-link> : A simple illustration of usage with the low code engine.
-  <cross-link target="openalea.api">@vs-flow/tb-openalea</cross-link> : API reference of the openalea modules of the 
   low-code toolbox.
